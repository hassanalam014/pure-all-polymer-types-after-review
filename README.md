# Pure All Polymer Types After Review

**pure-all-polymer-types-after-review** is a Python-based research repository that collects, reviews, and organizes **thermodynamic and glass-transition parameters for pure polymer systems**.  
The project compiles experimentally validated and literature-reviewed data and provides reusable scripts for analysis, comparison, and visualization of polymer properties.

This repository is primarily intended for **polymer physics, materials science, and thermodynamic modeling research**.

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Provide a **centralized, reviewed dataset** of pure polymer parameters  
- Support **equation of state (EOS)** modeling and glass transition analysis  
- Enable **experimental vs theoretical comparisons** for polymer properties  
- Serve as a reusable reference for academic and research work
